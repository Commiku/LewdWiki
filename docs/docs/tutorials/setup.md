Welcome to the LewdBot setup tutorial, in here you will learn how to quickly get started.

### Adding LewdBot

If you haven't already, you should add LewdBot to your server. While doing so, please consider the initial set of
permissions you want to give her, since she needs certain permissions to enable certain features. You can
obviously change the permissions later thru Discord's configuration panel.

**Note**: Keep in mind that if you give her _any_ permissions on this screen, Discord will create an _integration_ role
called LewdBot. If you want to use your own BOT role, remove all permissions on this page and add the role once the bot
joins your server.

### Setting up the Prefix

Once you have added LewdBot, she _may_ have sent a welcome message in your main chat (Will be sent to guilds that aren't
too big), so now the next step is to change the prefix.

LewdBot comes with 2 default prefixes, they are `L!` and `@LewdBot`, that means, that to use commands, you need to
type in `L!help` and so on.

To change the prefix required to activate the bot, you will want to use the `L!prefix` command. For example:
>To change the prefix to ! you would use `L!prefix !`.

**TIP: Prefixes are non-replaceable.**
That's right, your custom `$` prefix won't override `L!` or `@LewdBot`, that means you can always use those in case
you end up forgetting the custom prefix you set.

### Using the Bot

Now that you have added the bot, configured the permissions and set-up a prefix, the bot is ready to be used!

One extra step you can take is running `L!setup` which will ask you some questions related to features and will
auto-configure them for you.
