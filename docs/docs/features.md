### Music
LewdBot also supports music! Music features are free for all users (Except the volume command - that is Patrons only,
you can right click the bot however). Try `L!music` or `L!play Epic Sax Guy`.

### Fun
Bored? In need of some fun? We got you covered! LewdBot has quite a handful list of mini-games that you can play, like
casino-like slot `L!slot`, word-guessing `L!scramble`, coin-flipping `L!flip` and dice-rolling `L!roll`. You can also
chat with LewdBot, thanks to our PandoraBots-based chatbot! (To try it out, just send a DM to Lewdie!).

### Stability
And of course, stability. LewdBot has been running since 2015, back when Bots weren't more than just a user account.
We are well over 116k guilds now and always growing, this all thanks to our [Patreons](https://patreon.com/Fabricio20)
and long term supporters.
